## Shop Customer Data 📈
Is a detailed analysis of a imaginative shop's ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers. The owner of a shop gets information about Customers through membership cards.

### Dataset consists of 2000 records and 8 columns:

- Customer ID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score - Score assigned by the shop, based on customer behavior and spending nature
- Profession
- Work Experience - in years
- Family Size

## Conclusions 😱

Unfortunatly, this Dataset've been populating with randomly data. That means there are customers with "0" age and "3" work experiece and "$60000" annual income.
Thats create some inconsistences so I decided to don't use this dataset anymore.
